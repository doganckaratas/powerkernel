This folder should contain all module sources 
and drivers, since I decided to implement 
microkernel model, besides fundamental parts
of the kernel, all logic should be here.

kernel must contain simple memory management
and small utilities abstracted from architecture
dependent parts,

arch must contain platform bringup codes,
mostly architecture dependent

all other stuffs are in this folder.
